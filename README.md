# kitkat-coin

*This project was created using this starter kit with lotion.js and shea.js: https://github.com/keppel/lotion-shea-starter*

## Run the app

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Install Shea.js globally: `npm i -g shea`
1. Use the output command from npm run dev to connect to the node and run in the browser: `shea <GCI>`

You can now create new address which will be initialized with 1,000 KitKatCoin!

Follow instructions to check your account balances.

If you want to send money from one address to another, you much first check the balance of an account and that address will be used as the sending address (the UX for this will be made better in future updates).
